# Manufacters_Rotors_-_Stators
Educational group project for a Data Structure course.

You have been hired to develop a data acquisition system in a factory. This company develops rotors and stators. After carrying out the requirements survey, is evident that there are two major processes firing and impregnated. In the firing process is evident the taking of physical variables as temperature, humidity, pressure, the type of part that can be type A or type B. The plant engineer determines that if in the firing process the temperature of the piece is greater than 30.8, the piece will be bad than, otherwise it is taken as a good list for export, the pieces are packed in boxes of 5 units.

The impregnation process shows the use of 3 different types of sensors MQ2, thermocouple, laser; In addition to making physical measurements of the magnetic field, voltage, and resistance of the piece. As additional point, the system is required to carry information stored in a database where these variables are stored, sensor type, voltage, resistance of the piece. Furthermore, in this process the plant engineer determines that if the resistance is greater than 5ohm the piece will be bad, otherwise the piece will be good.

 Develop this system with a tree type structure
 
 Develop methods of inserting, searching, deleting, keeping count of pieces
 
 Determine the number of boxes produced
 
 Develop a main menu for the operator to monitor system options
 
 Make the connection to the database from C++ this will be taken as an extra point in the project
